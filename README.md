This code is mainly a POC for delta sync in owncloud. It uses zsync ( http://zsync.moria.org.uk/ )
and is heavily based on that source code.

Beware that this is messy, inefficient and undocumented code!

Use at your own risk.


Licence
-------
Currently this is licenend under the The Artistic License Version 2.0beta4
as that is the zsync licence. I still need to find out if this is GPL compatible.
